# Velorio
A 2D Game

Velorio is about a guy named Velorio, who had a tragic and sudden death but unfortunately, he has no memory of any of his life. His goal, using his newly found ability to slow time, is to find all the major events of his life so he can reach the afterlife before all his memories are lost to time.

As of right now there's 4 main "events" as Godot calls it.

(Pictures are included in each individual folder)

Main, World, Player, and Frog

Main (which definitely needs a renaming) has the title screen on it and works perfectly as intended except for the text boxes of which I have no clue how to use right now.

World has, well, the world, it has grass and a sky and collision boxes for the grass/ground

Player has all the code for the main player that allows you to control the player and has the main sprite for the character

Frog has that forbidden frog that will not detect the player but has some code linked to it and the asset that is a placeholder for an actual enemy sprite that I will make later.
